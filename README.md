## 🎨 Customization

### Styling

The site uses CSS variables for easy customization. The main variables are defined at the top of the CSS section:

```css
:root {
    /* Light Theme (default) */
    --background: #f9f5f1;
    --background-card: #ffffff;
    --text-primary: #3e3a39;
    --text-secondary: #5a5655;
    --accent: #d8b3a5;
    --accent-light: #e8d1c9;
    --border: #e6e0dc;
    --shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
    
    /* Common variables */
    --border-radius: 8px;
    --container-max-width: 1200px;
    --header-font: 'Playfair Display', serif;
    --body-font: 'Lora', serif;
    --ui-font: 'DM Sans', sans-serif;
    /* ... */
}
```

### Adding Categories

To add new product categories, simply include them in your CSV data. The site will automatically generate filter chips for any new categories.

### Category Colors

Product cards are color-coded by category. To customize or add colors for new categories, modify this section in the CSS:

```css
/* Category colors */
.product-card[data-category="Personal Care"] {
    border-left: 4px solid #e6a4b4;
}

.product-card[data-category="Kitchen"] {
    border-left: 4px solid #b6d7a8;
}

/* Add more categories as needed */
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The site loads the CSV data using PapaParse
2. The CSV is converted to JSON for easy processing
3. Filter chips are generated from unique categories and countries
4. The search input and filter chips update the filtering criteria
5. Products are filtered in real-time based on user selections
6. The product grid displays only matching products
